  # trying to start daemons by default it will cause the package install to
  # fail if there is no configuration at all. Pre-populating this directory
  # before package installation with the absolute bare minimum configuration
  # allows things to work and is enough to stop the post-install logic in the
  # RHEL package from firing as well
